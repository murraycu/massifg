MassifG is a GTK+ based visualizer for the output of valgrind's massif tool

MassifG uses the GNU autotools build system.


== INSTALLING ==
From tarball release:
./configure
make
make install
massifg [FILE]


== HACKING ==
Build from the git tree:
./autogen.sh --prefix=/wanted/prefix
make
make install
massifg [FILE]

Or, you can skip installing and run from the source tree:
./bin/massifg [FILE]

To compile and run the unit tests:
make check

To compile and run the functional test for the application:
make app-test
