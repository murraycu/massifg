== INSTALLING ==
MassifG uses GNU autotools to build and install.

Thus, do the following to build, install and run:
./autogen.sh --prefix=/wanted/prefix
make
make install
massifg [FILE]

To compile and run the program from the source tree (useful when hacking), do:
./autogen.sh
make
./bin/massifg [FILE]

To compile and run the unit tests, do:
make check

== BUGS ==
- Some massif output can break the graph, see for instance
tests/massif-output-broken-800.txt

== TODO ==
- Add description to graph
- Implement detailed graph
- Let users run massif directly from MassifG
- Let users export the graph to PDF/PNG from a saving dialog, or from the cli
- Create a custom widget that other applications can embed
